🚀 My Learning Journey
This game wasn’t just a fun coding project—it was my playground for learning prompt engineering, and I built it from scratch using Gemini AI as my coding companion. Instead of following tutorials or copying code, I set out to learn how to think, build, and iterate with the help of AI—and this project is the result!

I used prompt engineering as my core learning method: crafting smart queries, refining them, and exploring how to turn vague game ideas into working code, visuals, and audio. Every prompt was a lesson, every response a building block.

Here’s what I picked up along the way:

🎮 Front-End Game Dev (Achievement Unlocked!)
Designed and implemented the core loop of a 3D game: rendering, input handling, basic physics, and game state logic.

Gained hands-on experience with real-time interaction directly in the browser.

🧱 Three.js Basics (Now Playing in 3D!)
Built a 3D world with scene setup, object placement, lighting, and first-person camera controls.

Learned how to make the web feel more like a game engine.

🔊 Audio Magic with Tone.js
Programmatically created and controlled sound effects and atmospheric music.

Used sound to level up the player's experience.

📱 Responsive Design FTW
Ensured the game layout adapts beautifully across screen sizes—from phones to desktops.

🛠️ Debugging & Optimization
Tackled browser performance issues, collision problems, and sound timing bugs.

This project was more than just code—it was a collaboration between me and Gemini AI, powered by curiosity and prompt engineering. It shows how modern tools let you turn ideas into interactive experiences, and how learning can be way more fun when you're building something that responds, moves, and makes noise.

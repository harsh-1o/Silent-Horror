🚀 My Learning Journey
I built this game as a way to learn prompt engineering 🤖, using Gemini AI 🌟 as my coding sidekick. Instead of following tutorials, I crafted smart prompts, learned by doing, and turned my ideas into working code, visuals, and sound 🎮💡.

Every prompt was a mini-lesson, and this project became a playground where AI + web dev came together to create something interactive and fun 🎨✨.

🔧 What I Learned:
🕹️ Front-End Game Dev: Core loop with rendering, input, and simple physics.

🧱 Three.js: 3D scene setup, lighting, and first-person camera controls.

🔊 Tone.js: Dynamic sound effects and ambient music.

📱 Responsive Design: UI adapts to all screen sizes.

🐞 Debugging: Fixed performance, collision, and audio bugs.

This wasn’t just a coding project—it was a prompt-powered adventure 🚀 that proved how creative AI prompting can supercharge learning and make development way more fun 😄.
